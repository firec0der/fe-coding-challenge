# Welcome here!

1. **Codestyle**

We don't enforce any codestyle in this project,
but your codestyle must be consistent
(If you don't use semicolon, don't use it anywhere; If you don't like empty lines between a class declaration and render method, don't use it anywhere).

If you want to setup eslint or/and prettier - you're welcome, but please, don't waste time on it.

2. **Commits**

Commits - one of the important things for an efficient teamwork.
Please, keep the history clear for other developers.
In some cases clear history with clear commit messages could help you to understand changes even if you don't know the programming language.

Commits must be short, and logically consistent.
GUI tools like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) could help you to stage some specific lines of code.

3. **Code**

We like functional programming in Protetiko, so
it's nice if you (at least) don't mutate your data and do some simple FP things like pure functions, currying, function composition. You can use [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide) or [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) if you like to.

Please, use some typing (at least for components props) in the project.

4. **UI and design**

Make this project look pretty but don't spend too much time on it. If an CSS frameworks will help you speed up the UI/layout implementation, feel free to use one. Extra credit for hand crafted CSS though...

5. Finally, be mindfull of your work and these requirements. If you think that there is something obvious missing from the requirements, but something you think should always be present in a well built application, implement that, and let us know what you added.
