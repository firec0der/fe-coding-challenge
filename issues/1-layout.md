# App layout

You need create a layout that will be shared for all the pages.
Create `Header` component, think about proper folder where you'll keep this component (hint: it's related only for the app' layout).

Place some icon and dropdown there.
Dropdown must be expanded on icon click (It's very similar to the dropdown from the [google.com](google.com) page).

Add 2 links in the dropdown: "Home" and "Orders". "Orders" must move a user to the `/orders` page.
