# App layout

You need create a layout that will be shared for all the pages.
Create `Header` component, think about proper folder where you'll keep this component (hint: it's related only for the app' layout).

There must be a menu in the header.

- As a minimun, it can be a simple menu with two links to "Home" and "Orders". "Orders" must move a user to the `/orders` page.
- If you have time, make this menu a Dropdown menu, similar to the dropdown from the [google.com](google.com) page. There must be an icon in the header and clicking this link expands the dropdown menu.
