# Protetiko front-end coding challenge

### Background
Protetiko - is the new standard in dental order management. We build our product to make life of patients and dentists much easier.

Here we want to focus on your coding skills and built this project on top of [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It's considered to be the starting point of your coding challenge.
We use SCSS here, but you're free to add any CSS tool you love. That's also related to CSS frameworks, you're free to use any CSS frameworks and react components.

Regarding the redux, we set up [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) for you, because it's the easiest thing in the redux world.
If you do love [redux-saga](redux-saga.js.org) - just do it.

Also, there is an awesome thing that you have to follow -> [redux ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux). It's opionated, but we do love modules in Protetiko.
